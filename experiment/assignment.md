  <li>
    Find the steady-state temperature of the black body disc having a radius of 2 cm and mass 7 g at 45°C surrounding temperature, when initially kept at 28°C. Hence, determine Stefan's constant.
  </li>

  <li>
    Determine the net heat transfer through the black body disc with a radius of 4 cm and mass 9 g at 32°C when transferred to a surrounding temperature of 65°C.
  </li>

  <li>
    Find the steady-state temperature of the black body disc having a radius of 3 cm and mass 5 g at 10°C surrounding temperature, when initially kept at -10°C.
  </li>

  <li>
    Determine the net heat transfer through the black body disc with a radius of 1 cm and mass 6 g at 0°C when transferred to a surrounding temperature of 10°C.
  </li>

  <li>
    Determine the net heat radiated by the black body disc of mass 6 g and radius 4 cm at 40°C, initially kept at 30°C.
  </li>
