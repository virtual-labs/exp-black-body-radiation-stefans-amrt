<b> Experiment|     <b> Black Body Radiation: Determination of Stefan's Constant

### About the Experiment 

This experiment demonstrates the principles of blackbody radiation and allows the determination of Stefan’s constant (𝜎) using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. A blackbody, an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident radiation, is used to explore how the total energy radiated varies with temperature. The experiment involves measuring the power emitted by a heated filament as a function of temperature to verify the proportionality $𝑃∝𝑇^{4}, enabling the calculation of Stefan’s constant.
